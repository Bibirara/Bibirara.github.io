            <p>I am a visiting assistant professor of economics at James Madison University. <strong>My research is in macroeconomics, international economics, applied time series (macroeconometrics), and environmental economics.</strong>
                The strength of my research lies in building and solving dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models to study business cycles and environmental issues in emerging market economies, and using structural vector autoregressions to conclude empirical evidence from data.
                I am on the 2022/2023 job market and am available for job interviews.

                <p style="margin-top: 8px;"><span></span>This paper studies the extent to which business cycles in emerging market economies (EMEs) are explained by permanent shocks to total factor productivity (TFP).
                    I build a small open economy (SOE) real business cycle (RBC) model with a permanent TFP shock. Two financial frictions are added to the SOE-RBC model.
                    The financial frictions are a Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) collateral constraint and an endogenous risk premium in the world real interest rate.
                    The goal is to examine whether these financial frictions create a business cycle propagation mechanism for the permanent TFP shock that matches aggregate fluctuations in a Brazilian sample from 1999Q1 to 2018Q4 and a Mexican sample from 1997Q1 to 2018Q4.
                    Bayesian prior predictive analysis is applied to evaluate the SOE-RBC model fit on Brazilian and Mexican impulse response functions (IRFs) and forecast error variance decompositions (FEVDs) estimated by structural vector autoregressions (SVARs).
                    This paper shows a permanent TFP shock is the primary driving force of the business cycle in the SOE-RBC model. Next, the SOE-RBC model yields theoretical IRFs and FEVDs that replicate the ones produced from samples of Brazil and Mexico.
                    The findings of this paper support the hypothesis that a permanent TFP shock is the main source of business cycle fluctuations in EMEs.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 8px;"><span></span>This paper explores the predictions of real business cycle theory on the roles of total factor productivity (TFP) and financial frictions to explain business cycles in emerging
                    market economies (EMEs). I obtain evidence about TFP, price of capital, risk premium, and collateral constraint shocks by estimating structural vector autoregressions (SVARs) on a Brazilian sample from 1999Q1 to 2018Q4 and a Mexican sample from 1997Q1 to 2018Q4.
                    On each sample, two SVARs are estimated. One SVAR identifies shocks by imposing restrictions on their short-run impact. The other SVAR is grounded on restrictions that shocks have long-run effects on business cycles in EMEs.
                    Estimates of the SVARs show the TFP shock is the main driver of business cycle movements in Brazil and Mexico. However, this evidence is produced by the SVAR under the long-run restrictions, which indicates the identification of shocks matters to the
                    explanation of business cycles in EMEs. Next, the Brazilian and Mexican business cycles are markedly different, as the contributions of shocks to aggregate fluctuations vary across the two countries.
                    Hence, findings of this paper suggest although not all business cycles are alike in EMEs, “the cycle is the trend” view on aggregate fluctuations in EMEs remains valid.
                    The policy implication is that maintaining consistent monetary, fiscal, and trade policy regimes stabilizes business cycles in EMEs.</p>

                <div class="link">

                </div>
                <p style="margin-top: 8px;"><span></span>This paper uses a default model to study the impact of natural disaster clause on the sovereign debt and macroeconomic conditions in the Caribbean countries.
                    The international communities such as the World Bank Groups and International Monetary Fund are opening policy dialogues with Caribbean countries about introducing a natural disaster clause in their sovereign debt instruments.
                    Caribbean countries are frequently hit by devastating climate shocks (hurricanes and earthquakes). As a measure of helping these counties to rebuild their economy amid natural disasters, the natural disaster clause provides a temporary debt-servicing relief to them.
                    The natural disaster clause allows local governments to stop servicing debt for a period of time while preserving their access to financial markets. As a result, these countries can direct resources to rebuild their economies and recover production after hit by a negative climate shock.
                    However, such a debt clause may induce local governments to over borrow during expansions, and therefore increases the risk of sovereign debt default.
                    The goal of this paper is to study the extent to which a debt limit is optimal for including the natural disaster clause in the sovereign debt contracts for the Caribbean countries.
